Dynamic allocation is a concept in programming where memory is allocated at runtime, 
rather than at compile-time. This means that memory is allocated during the execution
of the program, and can be resized as needed during the program's execution.

Dynamic allocation is used to create data structures that can grow or shrink in size
during the program's execution, without the need for pre-allocation of memory. This 
is especially useful for creating data structures such as linked lists, trees, 
and graphs, which can change in size during the program's execution.

In most programming languages, dynamic allocation is performed using a set of memory
allocation functions, such as malloc, calloc, or realloc. These functions allocate a
block of memory of a specified size, and return a pointer to the first byte of the block.
The programmer can then use this pointer to access the allocated memory.

One of the benefits of dynamic allocation is that it can prevent the program from running
out of memory. By allocating memory dynamically, the program can adapt to the available
memory at runtime and avoid crashing due to a lack of memory. Additionally, dynamic 
allocation can help reduce the overall memory usage of the program, as it allows the 
program to only allocate memory when it is needed, rather than pre-allocating large 
amounts of memory that may not be used.

However, dynamic allocation can also introduce memory management issues, such as memory 
leaks and fragmentation, if not used carefully. It is important to properly manage dynamically
allocated memory to avoid these issues and ensure the program is using memory efficiently.
