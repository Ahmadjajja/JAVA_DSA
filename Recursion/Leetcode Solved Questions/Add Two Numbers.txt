You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself

Explanation:

The reason why this is important to specify is that in some programming languages, 
a number with a leading zero is interpreted as an octal number (base 8), rather 
than a decimal number (base 10). This can lead to unexpected results and errors in 
calculations, especially if the programmer is not aware of this behavior. To avoid 
this issue, it's best to ensure that numbers are written in decimal form without 
any leading zeros, unless the number is actually meant to be interpreted as an octal number.
